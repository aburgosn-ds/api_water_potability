# Machine Learning Project with DVC
This projects implements a machine learning algorithm to predict water potability from a dataset from Kaggle. It is performed the following steps: data collection, data preparation, model building, and model evaluation. 
All steps are tracked using Data Version Control. Finally, the best model found is made available as an API using FastAPI.
